# Advanced-Deployment-Techniques-in-OpenShift

Objectives
Implement advanced deployment strategies.
Use OpenShift's deployment capabilities to ensure zero-downtime deployments.
Understand the use of Blue-Green, A/B, and Canary deployment strategies.
Tasks:
1. Implement a Blue-Green Deployment for a Sample Application
2. Set Up an A/B Deployment and Understand How to Route Traffic to Different Versions
3. Implement a Canary Deployment and Gradually Increase Traffic to the New Version



Summary
Implementing a Blue-Green Deployment: Created deployment configurations for blue and green versions; controlled traffic between versions using a service and route.
Setting Up an A/B Deployment: Created deployment configurations for versions A and B; routed traffic to different versions using labels in a service and route.
Implementing a Canary Deployment: Created deployment configurations for baseline/main and canary versions; gradually increased traffic to the canary version using a route.
